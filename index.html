    <p> Have you ever wanted to learn how to beat-box? Well just follow along with the buttons on this helpful web-page and you too can be a passable beat boxer before long!</p>

    <button id="and"> and</button>
    <button id="cats"> cats</button>
    <button id="bees"> bees</button>
    <p> The recommended use of the site is to start with "boots", then to quickly move along to "cats", then going back towards the "boots". Once you're really getting a feel for it, feel free to toss in some "bees" and see how you feel!</p>
